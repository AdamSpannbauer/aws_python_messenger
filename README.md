### (written by an R programmer)

****************

## How to:

### I. Facebook Stuff
* Login/create account at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)
* Go to your [app page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) & create a new app

### II. AWS Stuff
#### Lambda Stuff
* Login/create an AWS account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Create a blank lambda function (no need to set a trigger at this point)
   * If you've never created a lambda function before follow [this guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/get-started-create-function.html) to create a Hello World python function.  We'll use the same setup in this example.
* On your new function's page on the Code tab, select upload a .ZIP file, upload the file parrot\_lambda\_env.zip from [my github](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/aws_python_messenger)
  * The contents of the zip file are the contents of the parrot\_lambda\_env directory.  The directory contains the python module [requests]() and a [python script](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/aws_python_messenger/blob/master/parrot_lambda_env/lambda_function.py) with definitions for functions to handle messenger events

#### API Gateway Stuff
* Go to [API Gateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway) 
* Create new api
   * After clicking Create New API, select New API, and give your API a name & description
